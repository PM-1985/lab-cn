Key Concepts & Theoretical Background
1. Local Area Network (LAN)

A LAN connects computers and devices within a limited area like a classroom, office, or lab.

Devices in a LAN can share data, printers, and internet resources.

Typically includes switches, cables, network interface cards (NICs), and computers.

2. Types of Networks
Type	Full Form	Range	Example
LAN	Local Area Network	Small area (office/lab)	Campus or building network
MAN	Metropolitan Area Network	City-wide	City government network
WAN	Wide Area Network	Large area (country/world)	The Internet
3. Transmission Media

Medium through which data travels:

Wired Media – Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fiber Optic

Wireless Media – Radio, Infrared, Microwaves

Types of Wired Media:
Type	Description	Speed	Common Use
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)	4 pairs of twisted copper wires	Up to 1 Gbps	LAN connections
STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)	Each pair shielded to reduce interference	Up to 10 Gbps	Industrial networks
Coaxial Cable	Central copper conductor + metal shield	Up to 100 Mbps	Older LANs, CCTV
Fiber Optic Cable	Transmits data as light signals	>10 Gbps	Long-distance, high-speed links

Network Setup Overview

The setup involves connecting 4 computers to a Layer 2 Switch using Cat5/Cat6 straight-through cables.

Each PC is assigned a unique IP address within the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.x).

⚙️ 3. Step-by-Step Instructions
A. Cable Preparation and Crimping

Purpose: To create a working Ethernet cable with RJ-45 connectors on both ends.

Steps:

Cut a Cat5/Cat6 cable to desired length.

Strip about 1 inch of the outer insulation jacket.

Untwist and straighten the 8 internal wires.

Arrange wires according to the T568B color code:

Pin | Wire Color
1 | White-Orange
2 | Orange
3 | White-Green
4 | Blue
5 | White-Blue
6 | Green
7 | White-Brown
8 | Brown


Trim the wires evenly (about ½ inch from jacket).

Insert the wires into the RJ-45 connector (pins facing upward).

Check alignment — all wires should reach the end of the connector.

Insert the connector into the crimping tool and press firmly.

Repeat for the other end of the cable.

Test the cable using a LAN Cable Tester for proper continuity and pin pairing.

⚠️ Tip: Use the same color sequence (T568B) on both ends for a Straight-Through Cable.

B. Connecting Devices

Connect each PC to the Layer 2 Switch using straight-through cables.

Ensure switch ports and NIC LEDs are glowing — this indicates active connections.

Verify cables are properly crimped and connected.

C. Configuring IP Addresses

Steps (Windows Example):

Open Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network Connections.

Right-click Ethernet Adapter → Properties.

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) → Properties.

Assign IP addresses as follows:

PC	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Default Gateway
PC1	192.168.1.1	255.255.255.0	192.168.1.254
PC2	192.168.1.2	255.255.255.0	192.168.1.254
PC3	192.168.1.3	255.255.255.0	192.168.1.254
PC4	192.168.1.4	255.255.255.0	192.168.1.254

Click OK and close all windows.

D. Testing Connectivity using PING

Purpose: To verify that all devices in the LAN can communicate.

Open Command Prompt on PC1.

Type:

ping 192.168.1.2


Observe the reply messages:

Reply from 192.168.1.2: indicates successful communication.

Request timed out: indicates a problem (check cables/IP).

Repeat ping tests between all PCs.

Expected Result:
All PCs should successfully respond to each other.

E. Capturing Packets using Wireshark

Purpose: To observe how PING packets travel within the network.

Steps:

Launch Wireshark on one of the PCs.

Select the active Ethernet interface.

In the filter bar, type:

icmp


(This filters only ping packets.)

Start a ping command from one PC to another.

Observe the packet details in Wireshark:

Source IP and Destination IP

ICMP Request/Reply

Time (ms) and TTL (Time To Live)

Stop the capture and save the file for your lab report.

Safety Precautions and Tips

Always power off devices before connecting/disconnecting cables.

Handle the crimping tool carefully to avoid injury.

Do not run cables near electrical equipment to prevent signal interference.

Keep RJ-45 connectors dust-free and properly inserted.

Use cable testers to detect cross-wiring before connecting to the switch.

📊 4. Data Collection and Analysis
Data to Record
Test	PC1	PC2	PC3	PC4	Result
Ping PC1→PC2	✓				Success
Ping PC2→PC3		✓			Success
Ping PC3→PC4			✓		Success
Wireshark Analysis

Observe:

Number of packets sent and received.

Round Trip Time (RTT).

Packet sequence (Request/Reply).

Protocol used: ICMP.

Expected Result:
Ping replies should show consistent RTTs and no packet loss.

🧾 5. Conclusion and Reporting
Conclusion

Thus, we have successfully:

Created and tested Cat5/Cat6 cables using RJ-45 connectors.
