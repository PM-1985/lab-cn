# Step-by-Step Instructions: DNS Lookup Program Practical (Based on EXPT_11.pdf)

***

## 1. Understanding the Experiment

### Key Concepts & Objectives
- **Objective:**  
  - Write a program for DNS lookup: Given a domain name, return its IP address; given an IP address, return the domain name.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) to machine-readable IP addresses and vice versa.
  - **DNS Resolution:** The process by which the DNS server finds the corresponding IP address or domain.
  - **PTR Query:** Used for reverse lookups (IP→domain).
  - **A Record:** Maps domain to IP, **PTR Record:** Maps IP to domain.

### Theoretical Background
- **DNS:**  
  - Distributed, hierarchical database; avoids central bottleneck.
  - Relies on recursive or iterative queries/federated authorities.
- **Lookup Process:**  
  - Client sends domain or IP to resolver (local DNS client).
  - Resolver contacts DNS server, which may forward or recursively resolve if needed.
  - Mapping is retrieved; client receives response.

## 2. Required Materials and Setup

### Materials & Tools
- Computer with any of:
  - Java (with JDK for compiling/running DNS lookup code)
  - Python (for socket-based DNS queries)
  - Internet access for live DNS queries
  - (Optional) IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, PyCharm, etc.)
- Example domain names, e.g., “google.com”.
- Example IP addresses, e.g., “8.8.8.8”.

### Experiment Setup

**Diagram (Logical Workflow):**
```
[User] --> [Your Program] --> [DNS Resolver] --> [DNS Server(s)] --> [Response]
```
- You’ll code a simple app/script that accepts either a domain or IP and prints the resolved value.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### A. Implementing DNS Lookup Program (Java Example)
*(Python alternative below)*

#### Java

1. **Create Java Source File:**
   - Name: `DNSLookup.java`
2. **Accept User Input:**
   - Prompt user for a domain name or IP address.
3. **Check Input Type:**
   - If input begins with a digit, assume IP; otherwise, domain.
4. **Use InetAddress Class:**
   ```java
   import java.net.*;
   public class DNSLookup {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           String input = args[0];
           InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(input);
           System.out.println("Host Name : " + address.getHostName());
           System.out.println("Host Address : " + address.getHostAddress());
       }
   }
   ```
5. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile: `javac DNSLookup.java`
   - Run: `java DNSLookup www.google.com` or `java DNSLookup 8.8.8.8`

#### Python

1. **Use Built-in socket Library:**
   ```python
   import socket
   input_val = input("Enter domain or IP: ")
   try:
       if input_val[0].isdigit():
           print("Domain name:", socket.gethostbyaddr(input_val)[0])
       else:
           print("IP address:", socket.gethostbyname(input_val))
   except Exception as e:
       print("Error:", e)
   ```

### Safety Precautions & Tips
- Check for typos in domain/IP input.
- Internet connection must be active.
- Handle exceptions for invalid or unresolvable addresses.

***

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Collect:**
  - Console output: domain-to-IP and IP-to-domain results for several queries.
- **Analyze:**
  - Confirm that common domains give expected IPs.
  - Confirm that public IPs map back to known domains (may depend on PTR record existence).
  - Note discrepancies or failures (e.g., local/private IPs or non-existent domains).

***

## 5. Conclusion and Reporting

### Writing Your Report

- **Introduction:**  
  Introduce DNS and its role in Internet communication.
- **Methods:**  
  Show code, explain how user input is processed, and how queries are performed.
- **Results:**  
  Provide outputs for several sample queries.
- **Discussion:**  
  Discuss how distributed DNS servers quickly resolve addresses; present benefits and limitations (e.g., outdated info, missing PTR records).
- **Conclusion:**  
  Summarize accuracy, speed, and real-world importance; note practical outcomes.

### Explaining to Examiner

- Use simple terms (“like a phone book for the internet”).
- Run code live or show sample results.
- Explain difference between A (domain→IP) and PTR (IP→domain) records.

## 6. Downloading and Accessing Resources

- **Java JDK**: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/]
- **Python Download:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
- **Sample DNS lookup guides:**  
  - Search “Java DNS Lookup Example” or “Python DNS Lookup Script”.
- No extra libraries are required—just ensure internet connectivity.
