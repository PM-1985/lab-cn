# Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions for TCP Socket Programming Practical  
*(Based on EXPT_5.pdf: TCP Socket Programming for "Hello" & File Transfer)*

***

## 1. Understanding the Experiment

### Key Concepts & Objectives
- **Objective:**  
  - Understand socket programming using TCP sockets.
  - Implement client-server communication (“Hello” exchange).
  - Transfer files over a wired network.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **Socket:** An endpoint for communication between two machines/processes.
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable data transfer.
  - **Client-Server Model:** One process acts as a *server* (waiting for connections); another acts as a *client* (initiates connection).

### Theoretical Background
- **Sockets:** Logical ports enabling processes to communicate over a network, identified by (IP address, port number).
- **TCP Sockets:** Guarantee order and reliable delivery of messages.  
- **Communication Steps:**
  - The *server* creates a socket and listens on a port.
  - The *client* creates a socket and connects to the server’s IP and port.
  - Data is exchanged using input/output streams.

## 2. Required Materials and Setup

### Materials, Tools, and Equipment
- Two computers on the same LAN (wired recommended).
- Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS.
- Programming language (Python, Java, or C recommended; examples below in Java).
- Text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Notepad++, or Eclipse).
- (Optional) Admin rights for network configuration.

### Experiment Setup

- **Logical Diagram:**  
  ```
  [Client PC] <---Ethernet---> [Server PC]
  ```
- Ensure both PCs are connected to the same wired network and know each other’s IP addresses.
- Enable firewall exceptions for the chosen port (default: 12345 or similar).

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### A. Server Program

1. **Create and Open Server Socket**
   - In code, create a server socket at a chosen port (e.g., 12345).
   ```java
   ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(12345);
   ```
2. **Listen for Incoming Connection**
   - Wait (block) until client requests connection.
   ```java
   Socket client = server.accept();
   ```
3. **Set Up Input/Output Streams**
   - For reading and sending data.
   ```java
   DataInputStream is = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());
   DataOutputStream os = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());
   ```
4. **Exchange Data**
   - Receive a message (“Hello”) from the client.
   ```java
   String received = is.readLine();
   ```
   - Respond (“Hello” or send a file).
   ```java
   os.writeBytes("Hello\n");
   ```
   - For file transfer: Use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream to read/write file bytes.
5. **Close the Connection**
   ```java
   client.close();
   ```

### B. Client Program

1. **Create a Socket & Connect to Server**
   ```java
   Socket client = new Socket("server_ip_address", 12345);
   ```
2. **Set Up Streams**
   ```java
   DataInputStream is = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());
   DataOutputStream os = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());
   ```
3. **Exchange Data**
   - Send a message to the server.
   ```java
   os.writeBytes("Hello\n");
   ```
   - Receive reply.
   ```java
   String serverReply = is.readLine();
   ```
   - For file transfer: Send/receive file bytes using file streams.
4. **Close the Connection**
   ```java
   client.close();
   ```

### Safety Precautions & Tips
- Make sure chosen port is open (not blocked by firewall).
- Handle exceptions in code to prevent crashes.
- Do not use reserved ports (below 1024) for custom applications.
- Test basic connectivity (ping) before proceeding to socket code.
- For file transfer, ensure files exist and permissions are set correctly.

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Data to Collect:**
  - Output displayed on client and server (e.g., “Hello” message, file transfer status).
  - Server logs: When the connection is established, messages received, files sent.
  - Client logs: Messages or file receipt information.

- **Analysis Methods:**
  - Check if both endpoints received intended messages/files.
  - For file transfer, compare MD5 hashes or file sizes to verify successful transfer.
  - Analyze error logs for potential connection or read/write issues.

## 5. Conclusion and Reporting

### Writing the Report:
- **Introduction:**  
  Briefly describe TCP socket programming and client-server communication.
- **Methods:**  
  Outline the steps above for both client and server, with code snippets.
- **Results:**  
  Include displayed output and screenshots of “Hello” exchange and file transfer.
- **Discussion:**  
  Highlight how TCP ensures reliable communication, any issues faced, and how you resolved them.
- **Conclusion:**  
  Confirm that bidirectional communication and file transfer was successfully demonstrated.

### Explaining to External Audience or Examiner:
- Start with “What is socket programming?”
- Briefly explain TCP and difference from UDP.
- Walk through your code, or demonstrate the live output.
- Mention challenges (e.g., network issues, firewall) and solutions.

## 6. Downloading and Accessing Resources

- **Java JDK:** [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/]
- **Python Download:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
- **C Compiler:** Use GCC (Linux) or MinGW (Windows)
- **Editor/IDE:** VS Code, Eclipse, Notepad++
- (For advanced GUI testing) Download WireShark for packet analysis: [https://www.wireshark.org/]
- Ensure both computers are on the same network/subnet.
- Source code templates and full example code can be found at reputable coding tutorial sites (e.g., GeeksforGeeks, TutorialsPoint, StudyTonight).

***

**Tip:**  
Always run the server program *before* the client so it’s ready to accept incoming connections!  
Double-check IP addresses and ports if connection fails.
