# Step-by-Step Instructions: Performance Study of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP Using Cisco Packet Tracer

***

## 1. Understanding the Experiment

### Key Concepts & Objectives
- **Objective:**  
  Study and analyze the performance of HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Used for transmitting web pages; data is sent in plain text.
  - **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** HTTP over SSL/TLS, encrypting all data, providing confidentiality and integrity.
  - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for file transfer between computers over a network, typically authenticates users but transfers data (including passwords) in plain text unless secured (SFTP/FTPS).

### Theoretical Background
- **FTP:**
  - Operates in client-server mode.
  - Laptops/PCs use FTP clients to connect to FTP servers for uploading/downloading files.
  - Data and credentials sent in clear text (unless secured).
- **HTTP/HTTPS:**
  - HTTP is not encrypted; HTTPS uses SSL/TLS for security.
  - Both are used for accessing web content and exchanging data over browsers.

## 2. Required Materials and Setup

### Materials, Tools, and Equipment
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (download from [NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads))
- At least one PC/laptop and one server (from the device list in Packet Tracer)
- Ethernet cables for network connections

### Experiment Setup

#### Example Network Topology Diagram

```
[ Laptop (192.168.1.1) ]
            |
         [ Switch ]
            |
   [ Server (192.168.1.2) ]
```

#### Steps to Set Up:
1. In Cisco Packet Tracer, add:
   - A Laptop (PC) with IP 192.168.1.1/24
   - A Server with IP 192.168.1.2/24
   - A Switch, and connect all devices appropriately.
2. Assign static IP addresses as shown.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### **A. Configure FTP on Server**
1. Select the Server device.
2. Go to Services tab → FTP.
3. Ensure FTP service is ON.
4. Add/manage usernames and passwords (e.g., username: `cisco`, password: `cisco`—default in Packet Tracer).

### **B. Configure Laptop/PC**
1. Set Laptop’s IP address to `192.168.1.1`, subnet mask `255.255.255.0`.
2. Ensure it’s connected to the switch, which in turn is connected to the server.

### **C. Using FTP Client**
1. On the Laptop, open the Command Prompt.
2. Start FTP session:  
   `ftp 192.168.1.2`
3. Enter credentials (`cisco/cisco`) when prompted.
4. Test file transfer:
   - Use `put MyFile.txt` to upload a file.
   - Use `get MyFile.txt` to download a file.
5. Check the status in Server → FTP directory.

### **D. Using HTTP/HTTPS**
1. On the Server, enable HTTP and HTTPS services.
2. On the Laptop, open a web browser.
3. Go to:
   - `http://192.168.1.2`
   - `https://192.168.1.2` (if HTTPS is enabled)
4. Observe and compare browser responses for both protocols (HTTP is usually green/unlocked, HTTPS is secure/locked).

### **E. Extra: Upload file for HTTP access**
1. From the Laptop, upload an `.html` file to the HTTP server directory using FTP.
2. On the Server, open the HTTP File Manager and verify file presence.
3. Edit the Server’s `index.html` to include a link to your file.
4. Access your file from the Laptop browser via `http://192.168.1.2/YourFile.html`.

### Safety Precautions & Tips
- Ensure you use correct login credentials.
- Double-check IP addresses and cable connections.
- Verify services (FTP/HTTP/HTTPS) are running/enabled on the server.
- If a transfer fails, check network connectivity and service configurations.

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Collect:**
  - Logs/outputs from FTP commands (`put`, `get`, etc.).
  - Browser responses when accessing HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Server’s FTP and HTTP directories for file presence.
- **Analyze:**
  - Did upload/download succeed via FTP?
  - Is HTTP/HTTPS web content accessible?
  - Observe and explain difference: HTTP shows plain (unlocked), HTTPS shows secure (locked).
  - Note if FTP data/passwords are visible in plain text.

## 5. Conclusion and Reporting

### Writing Your Report:
- **Introduction:**  
  Briefly describe FTP, HTTP, HTTPS and their roles in networking.
- **Methods:**  
  Network setup in Packet Tracer, configuration steps, and testing process.
- **Results:**  
  Include FTP/HTTP/HTTPS outputs, file transfer logs, and screenshots.
- **Discussion:**  
  Discuss protocol differences:  
    - Security (plain vs encrypted)  
    - Usability  
    - Typical use cases
- **Conclusion:**  
  Summarize key findings about protocol security and file transfer effectiveness.

### Explaining to Examiner:
- Clearly identify the practical goal (protocol comparison, file transfer).
- Show the practical steps and explain how you tested each service.
- Highlight the importance of using secure versions (HTTPS, SFTP) for protecting data.
