# Step-by-Step Instructions: Studying the SSL Protocol Using Wireshark

***

## 1. Understanding the Experiment

### Key Concepts & Objectives
- **Objective:**  
  Study the SSL protocol by capturing packets using the Wireshark tool while visiting any SSL-secured website (e.g., banking, e-commerce).
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS:** Cryptography-based protocols ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity for Internet communications.
  - **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect packets exchanged over a computer network.

### Theoretical Background
- **SSL/TLS:**  
  - Encrypts web traffic so any intercepted data appears scrambled.
  - Provides authentication through certificates (browser verifies server identity).
  - Ensures integrity and confidentiality during data transfer.
- **Packet Capture:**  
  - Wireshark records network packets; with filters, you can isolate and inspect SSL/TLS records such as “Client Hello”, “Server Hello”, “Certificate”, and encrypted application data.

## 2. Required Materials and Setup

### Materials, Tools, and Equipment
- A computer with:
  - **Internet access**
  - **Wireshark** installed ([Download Link](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html))
  - A **modern web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Setting Up the Experiment

**Network Setup:**
- Your computer should be directly connected to the internet (via LAN/Wi-Fi).

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### A. Preparing the Environment

1. Install Wireshark from the official website.
2. Close unnecessary apps to reduce noise in packet capture.

### B. Starting the Wireshark Capture

1. **Open Wireshark.**
2. Select your network interface (usually “Ethernet” or “Wi-Fi”).
3. Click “Start Capture” (blue shark fin icon).

### C. Initiating SSL Traffic

1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to a secure website (URL starts with `https://`; e.g., https://www.bank.com, https://www.amazon.com).

### D. Applying Wireshark Filters

1. In Wireshark’s filter bar, type `ssl` or `tls` and click “Apply”.
   - This isolates only SSL/TLS-related traffic for easier analysis.

### E. Inspect SSL/TLS Packets

1. Stop capturing after several seconds to avoid excess data (click the red stop button).
2. In the packet list, look for:
   - **Client Hello** (from your computer to server)
   - **Server Hello** (from server to your computer)
   - **Certificate** (server presents its certificate)
   - **Application Data** (encrypted web content)
   - **Change Cipher Spec** (beginning of encrypted phase)
   - **Alert** (session closure, etc.)
3. Click on a packet and expand the “Secure Sockets Layer” or “Transport Layer Security” section to view its structure.

### Safety Precautions & Tips

- Only capture your own traffic; avoid private/institutional networks without permission.
- Do not enter sensitive passwords or financial info during experimental captures.

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Collect:**
  - Screenshots of Wireshark traces showing “Client Hello”, “Server Hello”, “Certificate”, and “Application Data” packets.
  - Details such as cipher suite, version, and content type from these packets.

- **Analysis:**
  - Note the handshake process: how keys and ciphers are negotiated.
  - See that “Application Data” is always encrypted (unreadable payload).
  - Observe server certificate details for authentication.

## 5. Conclusion and Reporting

### Writing Your Report

- **Introduction:**  
  Explain the purpose of SSL/TLS and the reason for using Wireshark.
- **Methods:**  
  Describe steps for setting up the capture and visiting a secure website.
- **Results:**  
  Present screenshots and descriptions of key packet types and fields analyzed.
- **Discussion:**  
  Discuss the SSL handshake, how security is ensured, and what each step does.
- **Conclusion:**  
  Summarize learnings regarding encrypted protocols and practical packet analysis.

### Explaining to Examiners

- Describe what SSL/TLS does in plain language.
- Walk through a Wireshark capture, naming each handshake step.
- Emphasize that encrypted web traffic keeps personal & sensitive information safe.
