Experiment No. 1: Types of Topologies and Transmission Media
🧠 1. Understanding the Experiment
Aim

To study and implement different network topologies (Bus, Star, and Mesh) and understand the types of transmission media using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Objectives

Understand the working of different types of topologies.

Study the concept of transmission media.

Learn to use the Cisco Packet Tracer tool for network simulation.

Key Concepts
Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT):

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation software developed by Cisco Systems that allows students and engineers to:

Design, configure, and test network setups virtually.

Implement topologies such as Bus, Star, and Mesh.

Observe data transmission and packet flow in real-time or simulation mode.

💡 Why use Packet Tracer?
It is cost-effective, easy to use, and ideal for learning before working on real network hardware.

Theoretical Background
1. Topology

A network topology defines the arrangement of network devices (nodes) and how data travels between them.

Types of Topologies Implemented:
A. Bus Topology

All devices are connected to a single communication line (bus).

Data travels along the bus and can be received by all nodes.

Easy to implement but difficult to troubleshoot when failures occur.

Advantages:

Simple setup.

Cost-effective (less cabling).

Disadvantages:

A single cable failure can bring down the entire network.

Performance decreases with more devices.

B. Star Topology

All devices connect to a central hub or switch.

The hub acts as the main controller for data transfer.

Advantages:

Easy to add or remove devices.

Fault isolation is simple.

Disadvantages:

Failure of the hub/switch stops the entire network.

C. Mesh Topology

Every device is connected to every other device directly.

Provides multiple paths for data transfer.

Advantages:

Highly reliable (no single point of failure).

Excellent for mission-critical networks.

Disadvantages:

Very expensive (more cables and ports needed).

Complex configuration.

Transmission Media

Transmission media refers to the physical pathways through which data travels in a network.

Types:

Guided (Wired):

Twisted Pair Cable

Coaxial Cable

Fiber Optic Cable

Unguided (Wireless):

Radio waves

Microwaves

Infrared signals

Cables	Copper Straight-through, Copper Cross-over, DCE Cable

Network Setup Overview

Each topology will be created and tested individually using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Step-by-step setup for all topologies:

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

From the End Devices section, drag and drop the required number of PCs.

From the Switches/Routers section, select the required devices.

Use appropriate cables:

Straight-through Cable: PC ↔ Switch connections.

Cross-over Cable: Switch ↔ Switch or Router ↔ Router.

DCE Cable: For serial connections between routers.

Configure IP addresses for each PC or Router.

Use Simulation Mode to observe packet transfer.

⚙️ 3. Step-by-Step Instructions
A. Bus Topology Implementation

Steps:

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Place 3 PCs and 3 switches on the workspace.

Connect each PC to a switch using a straight-through cable.

Connect the switches in series using cross-over cables (to form the “bus” backbone).

Assign IP addresses:

PC	IP Address	Subnet Mask
PC0	192.168.1.1	255.255.255.0
PC1	192.168.1.2	255.255.255.0
PC2	192.168.1.3	255.255.255.0

Click on each PC → Desktop Tab → IP Configuration → enter IP details.

Open the Command Prompt (CMD) on PC0 → type ping 192.168.1.2 and ping 192.168.1.3.

Observe successful ping replies and packet flow in simulation mode.

✅ Tip: Use simulation mode to visualize packet travel along the bus line.

B. Star Topology Implementation

Steps:

Open a new workspace.

Place 1 Switch (2950-24) and 5 PCs.

Connect each PC to the switch using Straight-through cables.

Assign IP addresses:

PC	IP Address	Subnet Mask
PC0	10.0.0.1	255.255.255.0
PC1	10.0.0.2	255.255.255.0
PC2	10.0.0.3	255.255.255.0
PC3	10.0.0.4	255.255.255.0
PC4	10.0.0.5	255.255.255.0

Ping between any two PCs to confirm connectivity.

Observe how data passes through the central switch in simulation mode.

⚠️ Common Mistake: Forgetting to assign subnet masks or using incorrect cables (always use straight-through between PCs and switches).

C. Mesh Topology Implementation

Steps:

Place five 1841 routers on the workspace.

Turn off each router before adding serial ports:

Click router → Physical tab → Power off → Drag two WIC-2T modules into empty slots.

Turn router Power On.

Connect each router to all other routers using DCE serial cables (for full mesh).

Click each router → Config tab → Interfaces → Serial0/0/0, enter:

IP Address (example: 172.16.x.x)

Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0)

Set Clock rate on DCE side (e.g., 64000)

Turn Port Status ON

After configuring all routers, run the simulation to verify connectivity.

💡 Tip: For faster results, test only partial mesh (3–4 connections) before full mesh setup.

Safety Precautions & Tips

Double-check IP configurations before ping testing.

Use “Auto Cable Select” in Packet Tracer if unsure which cable to use.

Save your work frequently (File → Save As).

Always switch off the router before adding/removing WIC modules.

📊 4. Data Collection and Analysis
