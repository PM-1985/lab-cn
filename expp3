## Step-by-Step Practical Guide for Experiment 3: Routing Protocol Configuration (RIP/OSPF/BGP) Using Cisco Packet Tracer

***

### 1. Understanding the Experiment

**Key Concepts & Objectives:**
- **Objective:** Learn how to configure a 3-router network using Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) inside Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Routing Protocols:** Determine how routers communicate routing information.
  - **RIP:** Uses hop-count as metric; simple distance-vector protocol.
  - **OSPF:** Link-state protocol; builds complete network topology map.

**Theory Background:**
- Routers need to share information to ensure data is sent via the most efficient path.
- RIP and OSPF are two different ways routers complete this task:
  - **RIP:** Sends complete route tables at intervals, limited to 15 hops.
  - **OSPF:** Advertises links/interfaces, uses areas for scalability, and supports faster convergence.

### 2. Required Materials and Setup

**Materials, Tools, and Equipment:**
- Computer with **Cisco Packet Tracer** installed (see instructions below for download).
- No physical hardware required.

**Network Setup:**
- 3 routers (named R1, R2, ISP or R3).
- Connect routers in a triangle (each router has at least one interface to both others).
- Each network between routers uses a unique subnet.

*Example Logical Diagram:*
```
        +-----+           +-----+           +----+
        | R1  |-----------| R2  |-----------| R3 |
        +-----+           +-----+           +----+
           |                |                 |
    192.168.20.0    192.168.10.0      192.168.1.0
```
***

### 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

#### **A. Cisco Packet Tracer Setup**

1. **Open Packet Tracer** and create a new workspace.
2. **Drag and Drop Devices:**
   - Place 3 routers.
   - Add a few PCs for end-to-end tests (optional).
3. **Connect Routers:**
   - Use ‘Copper straight-through’ cables for router interconnections.
   - Assign each connection to a different interface and subnet.

#### **B. Assign IP Addresses**

1. Click each router.
2. Go to "Config" tab > select interface (e.g., GigabitEthernet0/0).
3. Assign IP `'x.x.x.x'` and subnet mask `'255.255.255.0'`.
   - Example:
     - R1-R2: 10.10.10.0/24
     - R2-R3: 192.168.10.0/24
     - R3-R1: 192.168.1.0/24

#### **C. Configure RIP on Each Router**

1. Click **R1** > CLI tab:
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
network 10.10.10.0      // Network to R2
network 192.168.20.0    // Example: Network to R3
```

2. Repeat above steps on **R2** and **R3**, changing the `network` addresses to match their directly connected interfaces.

3. Example for R2:
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
network 10.10.10.0
network 192.168.10.0
network 192.168.1.0
```

#### **D. Configure OSPF (Alternative/Additional Step)**

On R1:
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 10.10.10.4 0.0.0.3 area 0
```
- Process ID can be any number (here, '1').
- Wildcard mask determines which interfaces are advertised.
- Repeat analogous configuration for R2 and R3, using their respective subnets.

#### **E. Test Network Connectivity**

1. Click any router or attached PC.
2. Use `ping <destination IP>` to check network reachability.
3. If ping is successful, routing is working properly.

#### **F. Safety Precautions & Tips**

- Double-check subnet assignments to avoid overlaps.
- Use version 2 for RIP for classless routing support.
- Save your configuration regularly (`write` or `copy run start` in CLI).

### 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Data Collection:** Use `show ip route` to collect routing table information from each router.
- **Ping Results:** Note ping success/failure for each route.
- **Analysis:** Confirm all routers have learned correct routes to all networks via routing protocol.

***

### 5. Conclusion and Reporting

**How to Write the Report:**
- **Introduction:** Briefly state the experiment's aim and concepts covered.
- **Methods:** Outline steps to configure RIP/OSPF and network design.
- **Results:** Show screen captures or output of routing tables and ping tests.
- **Discussion:** Discuss how each routing protocol worked, challenges faced, and how routing tables evolved.

**Explaining to an Examiner:**
- Use the diagram to show connections.
- Briefly mention the CLI commands and what each achieves.
- Explain the significance of successful pings between previously unreachable networks via routes.
