# Step-by-Step Instructions: DHCP Server Installation & Remote Software Installation

***

## 1. Understanding the Experiment

### Key Concepts & Objectives
- **Objective:**  
  - Install and configure a DHCP server.
  - Write a program to install software on a remote machine.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automates the assignment of IP configurations on a network, eliminating manual IP assignment and making management easier for large networks.
- **Theory Background:**  
  - Every device on a network needs a unique IP address.
  - DHCP allows automatic assignment (leasing) of IP addresses from a central server.
  - DHCP operations: DHCP Discover, Offer, Request, ACK/NAK, Release.
  - Benefits: Reduced manual errors, easier managing of large/roaming networks, rapid configuration changes.

## 2. Required Materials and Setup

### Materials, Tools, & Equipment
- Two networked computers (or virtual machines) with Ubuntu/Linux OS
- Administrative privileges on both machines
- Internet access to download software
- Text editor (e.g., gedit, nano)
- Terminal access (command line)

### Experiment Setup Diagram

- Both machines should be on the same network.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### A. Install and Configure DHCP Server on Ubuntu

1. **Install DHCP Server on PC1:**
   - Open terminal and type:
     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
     ```

2. **Configure DHCP Server:**
   - Edit the DHCP configuration file:
     ```
     sudo gedit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
     ```
   - Add/edit the following configuration (adjust subnet/range if needed):
     ```
     default-lease-time 600;
     max-lease-time 7200;
     option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
     option broadcast-address 10.1.32.255;
     subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
       range 10.1.32.10 10.1.32.20;
     }
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

3. **Restart DHCP Service:**
   ```
   sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart
   sudo service isc-dhcp-server start
   ```

### B. Configure DHCP Client (PC2) to Obtain IP Automatically

1. **On PC2, go to Network Settings:**
   - Set IPv4 settings to “Automatic (DHCP)” or “Obtain an IP address automatically”.
2. **Reconnect to the network.**
3. **Verify:**  
   - Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in terminal.
   - Confirm the IP is within the DHCP server’s specified range (e.g., 10.1.32.10–10.1.32.20).

### C. Remote Software Installation (Program/Script Example)

- Use SSH from server to remotely install software:
  - From PC1, run:
    ```
    ssh user@PC2_IP 'sudo apt-get install -y <software-package>'
    ```
- Replace `<software-package>` with the desired software (e.g., `curl`, `vim`).

### Safety Precautions & Tips

- Always verify network cables/connections before starting.
- Double-check the DHCP range does not overlap existing static IPs.
- Restart network interfaces if changes don’t take effect.
- Use secure passwords for SSH and restrict remote access as needed.

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Collect:**
  - The assigned IP addresses on the DHCP client.
  - Logs from DHCP server (usually in `/var/log/syslog`).
  - Output from remote software installation (`ssh` command result).

- **Analyze:**
  - Confirm DHCP assigned an IP within the expected range.
  - Test network connectivity (ping between PCs).
  - Check if the requested software is installed on the client.

## 5. Conclusion and Reporting

### Report Writing

- **Introduction:**  
  Describe the problems DHCP solves and experiment objectives.
- **Methods:**  
  Explain each step (installation, configuration, verification, remote install).
- **Results:**  
  Share screenshots or terminal outputs showing dynamic IP assignment and remote installation completion.
- **Discussion:**  
  Discuss DHCP’s advantages (automation, efficiency), issues encountered, and the use of remote software management.
- **Conclusion:**  
  Summarize the successful installation & configuration of DHCP, and demonstration of remote admin abilities.

### Explaining to Examiners

- Use clear, simple explanations (“DHCP = Automatic IP Address Assignment”).
- Show how manual configuration is error-prone vs. DHCP’s automated approach.
- Walk through terminal commands and their impact.
- Discuss how remote management saves time for network admins.

## 6. Downloading and Accessing Resources

- **DHCP Server:**  
  Install with `sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server`
- **Remote Tools:**  
  SSH is usually preinstalled on Linux; else, `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`
- **DHCP Conf Guide:**  
  - [Ubuntu Official Docs: DHCP Server](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ISC-DHCP-Server)
  - [Linux man page for dhcpd.conf](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/dhcpd.conf.5.html)
- **Practice:**  
  - Test in a virtual machine environment like VirtualBox or VMware if hardware is limited.
