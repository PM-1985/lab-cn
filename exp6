# Step-by-Step Instructions for UDP Socket Programming File Transfer Practical  
*(Based on EXPT_6.pdf: UDP Socket Programming for Script, Text, Audio, and Video Transfer)*

***

## 1. Understanding the Experiment

### Key Concepts & Objectives
- **Objective:**  
  - Learn to write a program using UDP sockets to transfer different file types (script, text, audio, video) between two machines.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A connectionless, unreliable protocol offering fast, simple delivery without guarantees.
  - **Sockets:** Software endpoints for sending/receiving data over a network.
  - **File Transfer:** Sending files as a series of packets from sender to receiver using network programming.

### Theoretical Background
- **UDP:**  
  - Does not guarantee message order, delivery, or error correction.
  - Suitable for real-time and bulk data where speed is prioritized over reliability.
- **Berkeley Sockets API:**  
  - A programming interface used to write network-enabled software.
  - Headers (`sys/socket.h`, `netinet/in.h`, etc.) provide functions for socket creation and communication.

## 2. Required Materials and Setup

### Materials, Tools, and Equipment
- Two computers on the same LAN network (wired is better for stability).
- Linux OS recommended (most examples are Linux socket code).
- C, C++, Python, or Java installed.
- Text editor/IDE (e.g., VS Code, Vim, Notepad++).
- Your files: at least one text/script file, and optionally audio (.mp3/.wav) and video (.mp4/.avi) for testing transfer.

### Setting Up the Experiment

- Connect both machines to the same LAN and ensure they can **ping** each other.
- Take note of both IP addresses.
- **Diagram:**

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### **A. Writing UDP Server (Receiver) Program**

1. Import necessary libraries (e.g., `sys/socket.h`, `netinet/in.h` for C).
2. Create a socket specifying UDP/DGRAM:
   - C: `int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);`
3. Bind socket to a well-known port (e.g., 7654).
4. Enter a loop; wait for data using `recvfrom()`, saving incoming data to a file.
5. On file completion, close the file and socket.

### **B. Writing UDP Client (Sender) Program**

1. Import libraries as in server.
2. Create a UDP socket.
3. Identify destination IP and port (server’s).
4. Open the file to send in read mode (binary mode for audio/video).
5. Send data chunks using `sendto()`, looping until end of file.
6. Optionally, send a special packet to signal end of transmission.
7. Close file and socket.

### **C. Running the Programs**

1. Compile server and client code on their respective machines.
2. Start the server program first (listening for incoming packets).
3. Start the client program (initiates file send).
4. Watch for transfer completion messages/output on receiver.

### Safety Precautions & Tips
- Test with small text files before attempting large or binary files.
- For audio/video, always use binary file mode to preserve data integrity.
- Be mindful of UDP’s unreliability—large files or busy networks may cause data loss or corruption.
- Handle exceptions/errors in code for missing packets or incomplete transfers.
- Never use privileged ports (<1024) without admin rights.

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Collect:**
  - Output from both programs—logs of packet sends/receives.
  - Verify the received file against the original (size, checksum, or manual comparison for text).
- **Analyze:**
  - Was the file received fully and correctly?
  - Compare transfer times for different file types.
  - Note any errors, packet losses, or corruption (especially for larger files).
  - For audio/video—try playing the file post-transfer.

## 5. Conclusion and Reporting

### Write Your Report With:
- **Introduction:**  
  Brief summary of UDP, sockets, and the experiment's purpose.
- **Methods:**  
  Steps taken, network setup, files/programs used, and parameters (IP, port).
- **Results:**  
  Screenshots, logs, and evidence of file arrival and integrity.
- **Discussion:**  
  How UDP’s speed/reliability affected the results, issues faced, and improvements possible (like adding integrity checks).
- **Conclusion:**  
  What you learned about UDP programming and practical file transfer over networks.

### Explaining to Examiners/External:
- Briefly define UDP and contrast it with TCP.
- Walk through your network diagram and code structure.
- Demonstrate file transfer and highlight key output/verification.
- Explain any limitations and how you could improve reliability (e.g., adding retransmissions or checksums).

## 6. Downloading and Accessing Resources

- **Linux:**  
  Usually comes with GCC/C/Make, no installation needed for sockets.
- **Python:**  
  Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/], use built-in socket module.
- **Tutorials and Sample Code:**  
  - "UDP File Transfer Python Example" or "UDP Socket Programming in C"
  - [GeeksforGeeks UDP Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/udp-server-in-c/)
  - [Programiz Python UDP Socket](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/socket-programming#udp-server-client)
- Ensure both PCs are connected, firewall allows UDP on chosen port.
